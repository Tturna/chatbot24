# ChatBot24

A 2024 (and onwards) version of a general assistant program, mainly intended to be used via
a voice interface.

## (Wished/to be) Features

- **Human voice interface with Text-To-Speech feedback** - The app should be usable without a
kinetic human interface device like a keyboard, mouse, or mobile phone. A device with a microphone
and a speaker should be enough.

- **Chatting functionality similar to ChatGPT** - There should be a free language model
to chat with. It shouldn't rely on ChatGPT or other paid services.

- **Internet search with (and without?) AI** - Relatively fast multi-engine search with AI help.

- **News** - Ask for recent and relative news with specified filters like
time, location, or category.

- **Weather forecast** - Quickly get weather forecast info.

- **Music** - Ad free music playback.

<!-- - **Connect to other devices/services** -->

- **And more...**

    - Unit conversion
